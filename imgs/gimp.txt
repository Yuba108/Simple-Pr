MAKE CIRCULAR IMAGE IN GIMP :

- Add Alpha Channel
- Go to Layer > Transparency > Add Alpha Channel.
- This allows transparency. If it's grayed out, it's already added—great!
- Select the Circular Area
- Use the Ellipse Select Tool (E key).
- Drag to select the circular part you want to keep.
- Hold Shift for a perfect circle.
- Invert the Selection
- Go to Select > Invert to select everything outside the circle.
- Delete the Background
- Press Delete on your keyboard.
- You should now see a checkerboard pattern around the circle—that means transparency.
- Crop to Content
- Go to Image > Crop to Content to remove excess transparent space.
- Export as PNG
- Go to File > Export As.
- Choose .png format (JPEG doesn’t support transparency).
- In the export dialog:
- Make sure “Save color values from transparent pixels” is unchecked.
- Click Export.
